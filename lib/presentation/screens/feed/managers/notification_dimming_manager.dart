// This functionality has been moved to dimming_manager.dart to:
// 1. Prevent code duplication
// 2. Keep dimming logic centralized
// 3. Maintain consistency with the app's dimming system
//
// See DimmingManager class for the implementation of:
// - Notification-specific dimming configurations
// - Excluded keys management
// - Dimming state updates
